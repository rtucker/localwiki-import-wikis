These are scripts to import legacy wiki engines (MediaWiki, Sycamore / WikiSpot.org) into LocalWiki.

Very rough right now. Please tell us about your experiences on #localwiki on Freenode.

Usage
-----

To import pages from an existing MediaWiki site into LocalWiki, do the following:

1. Activate the virtualenv used for LocalWiki (typical path shown)::

   $ source /usr/share/localwiki/env/bin/activate

2. Install the localwiki-importers package::

   (env)$ pip install localwiki-import-wikis

3. Add 'localwiki_importers' to LOCAL_INSTALLED_APPS in /usr/share/localwiki/conf/localsettings.py::

   LOCAL_INSTALLED_APPS = ('import_wikis',)

4. Now you can run the import command like this::

   $ localwiki-manage import_mediawiki

Follow the prompts to complete the import!

5. Build the search index::

   $ localwiki-manage rebuild_index

6. The import will grab users and their edit history, but it won't import their
   email address or password.  If you have a way to obtain the old user
   passwords, you can run the following::

   $ localwiki-manage import_mediawiki --users_email_csv=<users_csv>

Where `users_csv` is a CSV file of the form username,email.

Users will then be able to log in after they reset their password.


Apache config
-------------

There is an example apache config in conf/ that will help with migrating
old mediawiki-style URLs.  We strive for near 100% URL compatibility
with MediaWiki because breaking links just isn't cool.
