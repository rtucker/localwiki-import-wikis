These are scripts to import legacy wiki engines (MediaWiki, Sycamore / WikiSpot.org) into LocalWiki.

Very rough right now. Please tell us about your experiences on #localwiki on Freenode.

To import pages from an existing MediaWiki site into LocalWiki, do the following:

1. Activate the virtualenv used for LocalWiki (typical path shown):
   $ source /usr/share/localwiki/env/bin/activate

2. Install the localwiki-importers package:
   (env)$ python setup.py install

3. Add 'importers' to LOCAL_INSTALLED_APPS in /usr/share/localwiki/conf/localsettings.py:
   LOCAL_INSTALLED_APPS = ('importers',)

4. Now you can run the import command like this:
   $ localwiki-manage import_mediawiki

Follow the prompts to complete the import.
